# Welcome to All About Trees!
We hope you are a very curious person who likes to find patterns, analyze data, and loves trees.

All About Trees is an app designed for people like you who want to know more and use technological tools to change their environment and reality.

## What is it?
In a few words, All About Trees is a visual query builder. This means it's a tool that can help you convert your questions or doubts about certain trees and, with the aid of the USFIA Database, answer them in a visual way (using graphics like Pie Charts, for example). The idea is to take advantage of this free data and use it easily.

## How does it work?
When you enter our landing page, you will find a login UI. It is not necessary to give any personal data; just create a user with an interesting username. Then, you will be taken to the query builder, where with a few pieces of data, you can answer interesting questions about trees according to the USFIA records from the 1900s to the 2020s.

## An interesting query? Why don't you save it?
When you perform a query, on the right side of the page, you have the option to give it a name and save it for later review. You will find it on your profile page (at the top of the page in the navigation bar).

## Searching for ideas? Why not explore other users' queries?
On the navigation bar, there is a button that says 'query search.' There, you will find all the queries posted by other users, and if you find them interesting, you can click on them, and the parameters of the query will be recreated by pressing the reset button.

# How to start?
Just let your imagination surprise you. Start with a simple query like the default one and vary the number of result items to obtain better precision.
